# 4CCS1IAI-Report
This is a small project I did with another collaborator as part of the 4CCS1IAI module at King's College London. The aim was to create a fictional scenario to be solved by an Artificial Intelligence planner. Both the domain and the problems were written in the PDDL markup language, which is a markup language used for AI planners. These were then run in an internal King's College London AI planner named OPTIC, and the results were analysed in these reports.
